**Intelligent Traffic Management System - Hardware Design**

**System Overview**
This document outlines the hardware components and circuit design required to implement the intelligent traffic management system based on computer vision and AI decision-making. The system utilizes cameras to monitor traffic flow, a central processing unit to analyze the data (potentially via cloud APIs or local models), and controls standard traffic light signals accordingly. It includes communication modules for data transfer and emergency alerts, along with a robust power system.

            *   *USB Cameras:* USB 3.0 interface for sufficient bandwidth. Powered via USB or separate 12V input. Consider industrial USB cameras for better robustness and longer cable runs.
            *   *PoE Option:* Use PoE-enabled USB cameras or standard cameras with PoE splitters (IEEE 802.3af/at) for simplified wiring, providing both data (via Ethernet adapter if needed for RPi) and power over a single Ethernet cable. Requires a PoE-capable switch or injectors.
    *   **Camera Placement:**
        *   Mounted on traffic poles or dedicated masts at 3-5 meters height.
        *   One camera per approach direction (North, South, East, West).
        *   Angled downwards to view multiple lanes of approaching traffic and the stop line area. Avoid direct view of the sun where possible.
        *   Ensure enclosures remain clear (hydrophobic coating, potential for small wiper/washer in high-pollution areas).

3.  **Traffic Light Control System**
    *   **Components (Per Direction - 4 Sets Total):**
        *   LED Arrays: High-brightness, outdoor-rated 12V DC LED modules (Red, Yellow, Green). Standard traffic light diameter (e.g., 200mm or 300mm).

        *   Housings: Standard, weatherproof traffic light signal heads designed for pole mounting.
        *   Isolation: Optoisolators between Raspberry Pi GPIO pins and MOSFET gates for electrical isolation and noise immunity.
    *   **Control:** Each of the 12 LEDs (4 directions x 3 colors) is individually controllable via a dedicated Raspberry Pi GPIO pin connected to its respective driver circuit.

4.  **Communication Modules**
    *   **Network Communication:**
        *   Primary: Raspberry Pi Gigabit Ethernet port connected via outdoor-rated Ethernet cable to a network switch/router with internet access.
        *   Backup: 4G/LTE USB Modem (e.g., Quectel EC25-A, Huawei E3372) or dedicated LTE router connected via Ethernet. Requires appropriate SIM card with data plan.
        *   Local Access: Raspberry Pi built-in Wi-Fi configured as an Access Point (AP) for on-site maintenance and diagnostics using a laptop or phone. Secure with WPA2/WPA3.
    *   **Emergency Alert System:**
        *   Module: SIM800L GSM/GPRS module (or SIM7600 series for 4G capability if alerts need faster data/higher reliability).
        *   Antenna: External SMA high-gain antenna mounted outside the main enclosure for optimal cellular reception.
        *   SIM Card: Separate SIM card (can be low-data plan, e.g., M2M/IoT plan) primarily for sending SMS alerts (e.g., system failure, emergency vehicle detection override).
        *   Interface: Connected to Raspberry Pi via UART (requires level shifting if module logic level differs from RPi's 3.3V).

5.  **Power System**
    *   **Main Power Input:**
        *   Source: 110V AC or 220V AC mains power from street infrastructure.
        *   Protection: Input circuit breaker, surge protector (MOV-based), and EMI filtering.
    *   **Primary Conversion:**
        *   AC-DC Converter: Industrial-grade, enclosed power supply (e.g., Mean Well LRS-150-12 or RSP-150-12) converting mains AC to 12V DC. Minimum 10A capacity (120W), size based on total load calculation (Pi, LEDs, cameras, sensors).

            *   12V to 5V Buck Converter (e.g., MP1584EN based modules, or higher current rated like LM2596HV). Minimum 3A dedicated to Raspberry Pi, additional 2-3A for other 5V components (sensors, GSM module). Use separate converters for Pi and other peripherals for stability.
            *   (Optional) 12V to 3.3V Buck Converter if any sensors require direct 3.3V power.
        *   Distribution Board: Custom PCB or terminal block system with clearly labeled outputs and individual fuses (PTC resettable fuses recommended) for each major component (Pi, each camera, LED drivers, GSM, sensors).
    *   **Backup Power:**
        *   Battery: 12V, 20Ah (or higher capacity based on desired runtime) deep-cycle Lead-Acid (AGM/Gel) or LiFePO4 battery. LiFePO4 is lighter and has longer cycle life but requires a compatible charge controller.
        *   UPS / Charger Circuit:
            *   Battery Charger: Dedicated 12V smart charger circuit compatible with battery chemistry (e.g., based on TP4056 for single Li-ion cells *if used*, but typically a dedicated 12V multi-stage charger IC for lead-acid/LiFePO4).
            *   Automatic Switchover: Use a relay module controlled by mains power detection, or a dedicated UPS module that automatically switches from mains-powered 12V DC to battery 12V DC upon power failure. Ensure minimal switchover time to avoid RPi reboot.
        *   Solar Charging (Optional):
            *   Panel: 50W (or higher) 12V solar panel suitable for outdoor conditions.

2.  **LED Driver Circuit (Per R/Y/G LED - Repeat 12 Times)**
      <img width="816" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-02 at 12 18 44 pm" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72318cec-4634-4dd4-8885-8c8504961a26" />

    *   **Components (per channel):** IRLZ44N Logic-Level N-Channel MOSFET (or equivalent rated for LED current), 4N35 Optoisolator, 1kΩ resistor (GPIO to Opto Input), 10kΩ resistor (MOSFET Gate pull-down), High-brightness 12V LED array, Power resistor for current limiting (calculate based on LED specs and 12V supply, *often built into 12V arrays*). Ensure MOSFET has adequate heatsinking if switching high currents.

4.  **GSM Communication Circuit**
 
   <img width="779" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-02 at 12 18 16 pm" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1717c6b5-d0e3-496f-9113-a1ad63169739" />

    *   **Components:** SIM800L module (check voltage requirements - some need ~4V, requiring another buck converter stage, others tolerate 5V directly), Bidirectional Logic Level Shifter (if SIM800L uses voltage levels other than 3.3V, common for older modules), 1000µF electrolytic + 100nF ceramic capacitors across SIM800L VCC/GND placed *very close* to the module pins to handle transient current spikes during transmission, SMA pigtail and external antenna. **Crucial:** Provide a stable power source capable of handling >2A peaks.

5.  **Camera Connection**
    *   **For Raspberry Pi Camera (CSI):**
        *   Connect HQ Camera module to Raspberry Pi CSI port using appropriate length ribbon cable. Ensure cable is routed away from power lines and potential noise sources. Use shielded cables for longer runs if necessary.
        *   Power supplied via ribbon cable (check Pi's total power budget) or separate 5V input if camera module supports it.
        *   Camera module fits inside a weatherproof enclosure.
    *   **For USB Cameras:**
        *   Connect USB camera to one of the Raspberry Pi's USB 3.0 ports (preferred for higher bandwidth).
        *   Use high-quality, powered USB 3.0 extension cables if needed, but minimize length. Max recommended length for passive USB 3.0 is ~3 meters. Active extensions needed for longer runs.
        *   If using PoE cameras: Connect camera via Ethernet cable to a PoE switch or injector. Connect the PoE switch/injector's data port to the Raspberry Pi's Ethernet port (or via a USB-Ethernet adapter if Pi's port is used for main network). The PoE splitter near the camera provides power and Ethernet data breakout if the camera isn't natively PoE.
        *   Ensure USB camera is housed in a suitable weatherproof enclosure.

6.  **Main Control Board Connections (Raspberry Pi GPIO Pin Assignments - Example)**
    *   **Traffic Lights (12 Pins):**
        *   Pins BCM 2, 3, 4: North Traffic Light (R, Y, G) -> via Opto/MOSFET Drivers
        *   Pins BCM 17, 27, 22: East Traffic Light (R, Y, G) -> via Opto/MOSFET Drivers
        *   Pins BCM 10, 9, 11: South Traffic Light (R, Y, G) -> via Opto/MOSFET Drivers
        *   Pins BCM 5, 6, 13: West Traffic Light (R, Y, G) -> via Opto/MOSFET Drivers
    *   **Communication (UART - 2 Pins):**
        *   Pins BCM 14 (TXD), 15 (RXD): UART for GSM module -> via Level Shifter

        *   Pin BCM 25: Manual override button input (pull-up/down resistor needed)
    *   **I2C Bus (2 Pins - Shared):**
        *   Pins BCM 2 (SDA), 3 (SCL): Standard I2C Bus for Sensors
            *   Connect INA219 Battery Monitor
            *   Connect BME280/680 Weather Sensor (if used)
            *   Connect BH1750 Light Sensor (if used)
            *   *Note:* Ensure unique I2C addresses for all devices. Pins BCM 2, 3 are also used for North Lights in this example; requires careful selection or using alternate I2C bus if available/configured. *Revision:* It's better to use dedicated I2C pins (GPIO 2/3) and reassign North R/Y (e.g., to GPIO 7, 8). Let's adjust:
                *   **Revised North Lights:** Pins BCM 7, 8, 4 (R, Y, G)
                *   **I2C:** Pins BCM 2 (SDA), 3 (SCL) - Now clear for sensors.
    *   **SPI Bus (Optional - 4 Pins):**
        *   Pins BCM 10 (MOSI), 9 (MISO), 11 (SCLK), 8 (CE0): Standard SPI Bus
            *   Connect MCP3008 ADC (if used for analog sensors like microphones)
            *   *Note:* Pins 9, 10, 11 were assigned to South Lights. Need reassignment. Let's adjust:
                *   **Revised South Lights:** Pins BCM 19, 16, 26 (R, Y, G)
                *   **SPI:** Pins BCM 10(MOSI), 9(MISO), 11(SCLK), 8(CE0) - Now clear for SPI devices.
    *   **Optional GPIO Sensors (Variable Pins):**
        *   Pin BCM 20: PIR Sensor 1 Output
        *   Pin BCM 21: PIR Sensor 2 Output
        *   Pin BCM 12: Rain Gauge Input (Tipping Bucket Pulse)
        *   *(Assign remaining available GPIOs as needed)*

**System Enclosure**

*   **Type:** Large, lockable, weatherproof enclosure (NEMA 4X / IP66 or higher).
*   **Material:** Polycarbonate or painted steel.
*   **Features:**
    *   Mounting plate inside for securely attaching Raspberry Pi, power supplies, driver boards, distribution blocks.
    *   Ventilation: Filtered vents, potentially with thermostatically controlled fans for heat dissipation from Pi and power supplies.
    *   Cable Glands: Waterproof cable glands for all external connections (AC Power In, Ethernet, Camera Cables, Traffic Light Control Cables, Antenna Cable, Sensor Wires).
    *   Mounting: Pole mounting brackets.
    *   Security: Lockable latches.

**Interconnects and Wiring**

*   **High Voltage (AC):** Use appropriately rated wires and connectors, follow electrical safety codes. Ensure proper grounding.
*   **Low Voltage DC (12V/5V Power):** Use appropriate wire gauge based on current draw and distance (e.g., 16-18 AWG for main 12V distribution, 20-22 AWG for 5V lines). Use screw terminals or reliable connectors (e.g., XT30/XT60 for higher current).
*   **Signal Wires (GPIO, UART, I2C, SPI):** Use 22-26 AWG wire. Keep signal lines short where possible. Use twisted pairs for differential signals or longer runs (e.g., Ethernet). Use appropriate connectors (Dupont, JST-XH, screw terminals).
*   **External Cables:** Use outdoor-rated, UV-resistant cables (e.g., Direct Burial Cat6 Ethernet, outdoor power cables, multi-conductor signal cables).
*   **Cable Management:** Use cable ties, conduits, and labeling for a clean, maintainable installation inside the enclosure.

**Safety and Failsafe**

*   **Isolation:** Opto-isolation on all traffic light control lines is critical.
*   **Fusing:** Individual fuses on all major power outputs prevent component failures from cascading.
*   **Grounding:** Proper AC safety ground connection for the enclosure and AC components. Common DC ground reference for all low-voltage components.
*   **Failsafe Mode:** The software should implement a failsafe state (e.g., revert to flashing Red/Yellow, or a pre-programmed basic timing cycle) if the main AI/Vision processing fails or communication is lost for an extended period. This could be triggered by a watchdog timer.
*   **Manual Override:** Physical button input to allow manual control or triggering of a safe state by maintenance personnel.
